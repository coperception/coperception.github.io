# SoRoSE: Soft Robot State Estimation (IROS'2021 workshop)

## Abstract
An increasing number of robots are made of soft materials. Because they are inherently safe to interact 
with, soft robots have been widely used in human-robot interactions. Moreover, due to their flexibility, 
they adapt to their environment, requiring less precision in certain tasks like grasp planning.

Nonetheless, soft robotic state estimation has its unique challenges. In general, soft robots are underactuated and have infinitely many degrees of freedom. They undergo large deformations and hence display 
a highly nonlinear hyperelastic behaviour. Furthermore, because many applications involve contact, we 
require state estimation algorithms to scale well and perform robustly in contact-rich interactions with 
humans or environments. To balance precision and timing requirements, novel proprioceptive sensing 
and Modeling are needed to estimate a soft robot’s state efficiently and effectively. Real-time state estimation also paves the way towards closed-loop control of soft robots.

This workshop aims to exchange new knowledge, discover inspiring trends, and advance integrated software and hardware techniques for soft robot sensing and the estimation of their internal states, such as 
geometric shape and properties, strain- and stress-related quantities in quasi-static settings, and velocities and accelerations in dynamic settings. Our goal is to connect communities and stimulate collaborative research.

## Extended Abstract Submission
We invite researchers working on related topics to submit **abstracts or extended abstracts** (no 
longer than 4 pages in IROS paper format, including references) that can contribute to this workshop.

Desired Works could:
+ identify novel state estimation theories and algorithms for robots with parts made of soft materials, 
+ discuss state estimation in the context of applications in soft robotics, human-robot interaction,  or  wearable  devices, 
+ demonstrate  real-time  state  estimation  with  limited  precision for closed-loop or accurate state estimation for open-loop control, 
+ describe novel integrated hard- and software prototypes of proprioceptive soft robots, 
+ review and benchmark various methods proposed by different communities (e.g., robotics, HCI, HRI) with the ultimate goal to enhance the mutual understanding of challenges and opportunities related to this workshop.
